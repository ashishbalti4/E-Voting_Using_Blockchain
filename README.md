Designed and developed a secure voting system leveraging blockchain technology to ensure transparency and maintain integrity throughout the voting process.

Implemented a robust voter authentication mechanism using Aadhar numbers to ensure each voter receives a unique identifier, thereby preventing multiple voting attempts.

Utilized blockchain's decentralized ledger to securely record and store votes, ensuring tamper-proof results that cannot be altered even by administrators before the election concludes.

Focused on maintaining confidentiality by designing the system to withhold intermediate voting results from any unauthorized access, including administrators, until the election concludes.
